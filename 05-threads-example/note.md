# Node worker threads module

The worker_threads module in Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code in separate threads, which can improve performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores and handling CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the event loop (process in parallel). This can lead to better scalability and responsiveness for applications.

```js
const { isMainThread, workerData, Worker } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  console.log(`Main Thread! Process ID: ${process.pid}`);
  new Worker(__filename, { workerData: [7, 6, 2, 3] });
  new Worker(__filename, { workerData: [1, 3, 4, 3] });
} else {
  console.log(`Worker! Process ID: ${process.pid}`);
  console.log(`${workerData} sorted is ${workerData.sort()}`);
}
```

explain this code:

This code snippet is using the worker_threads module in Node.js to create multiple worker threads. If the code is running in the main thread, it creates two worker threads, each with its own set of worker data. If the code is running in a worker thread, it logs the worker process ID and sorts the worker data.
